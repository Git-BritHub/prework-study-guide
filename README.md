# Brittany's Study Guide

The creation of this study guide was an invaluable project that helped me learn and practice the important steps and gitflow that go into creating a webpage. This project was created for boot camp students who were going through the prework and will serve as a helpful reference point in regards to HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.
